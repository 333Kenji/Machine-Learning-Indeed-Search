Bioinformatician Lead,Centaura,Remote,Today,2021-06-18,"3-5 years post-qualification experience as a data scientist, systems biologist or in a similar role. Strong scientific background in epidemiology/systems or…",,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=90b96e5300f40f74&fccid=fd5d9eb2f2e97a1d&vjs=3,None,"Centaura is a Switzerland-based start-up company engaged in Systems and Molecular biology research. We are a young and ambitious team of radical thinkers from across the globe, making groundbreaking discoveries in aging research. Our projects are running in the USA, UK, and Russia.At Centaura, we believe that complex diseases, especially those associated with aging, can be prevented and ultimately reversed by applying new molecular biological tools and computational approaches. Our aim is to dive deep into biological datasets, develop multi-target therapies, and translate our scientific findings into real products available for the global community.We are actively seeking a team leader to coordinate multiomics data analytics projects aimed at developing targets and payloads for Centaura’s flagship next-generation gene therapy vector, the human artificial chromosome (HAC). The ideal candidate will also have experience with analysis of repetitive sequences and ChIP-seq data, which will allow them to contribute to the refinement of the HAC vectors.About the ProjectThe HAC’s unique capabilities allow for multi-faceted approaches to gene therapy that put complex, multimodal non-Mendelian diseases into play. This includes those diseases that result from aging, as well as the aging process itself.Aging and its attendant diseases are the complex manifestations of the time-dependent loss of cellular homeostatic buffering capability, resulting in the functional decline of multiple organ systems. To combat aging and its related diseases, we will need to understand the timeline of the precipitating events during the period preceding the functional decline. We believe this is possible by leveraging large databases of “omics” data and applying advanced bioinformatic methods.These correlational associations (termed Aging Profiles) will then be tested for causal relationships with aging-associated phenomena by our molecular biology team. The pathways thus elucidated will then be targeted via HAC-based gene therapy as novel therapies for age-related disease.Position summaryTogether with your team, you will develop an algorithm to build these Aging Profiles. As the team leader, you will be responsible for building out your team, as well as identifying and gathering the datasets to mine for f novel aging pathways. You will work closely with the molecular biology team to test and validate these pathways, and, if necessary, assist with data-intensive molecular biological tasks. In this position, you will enjoy broad creative freedom to propose and pursue your ideas. Self-motivation, adaptability, and a strong passion for outstanding cutting-edge research are essential.The role described in this vacancy can be located remotely, though preference will be given to Boston-based candidates. You will report directly to the Chief Scientific Officer at Centaura.Tasks\- Identify and obtain necessary data from public sources and combine it with our existing datasets.\- Develop a comprehensive computational framework for integrating multi-omics and multi-tissue analyses and predicting aging modifiers:\- Data analysis pipeline for integrating various omics data into consistent formats and metrics. An example would be creating an age- cceleration/deceleration score, similar to an epigenetic clock biological vs chronological age differential\-Developing causal inferences from correlational data. Examples include:directed network analysis of transcriptomicdata transcription factor binding enrichment pathwayenrichment analysisregression modeling\- Integrate machine learning-based methods to generate unexpected insights and develop longitudinal models of aging\- Apply innovative data visualization concepts\- Assist molecular biology teams with sequencing analysis and other data-centric problems (e.g. analysis of repetitive sequences and consensus motif discovery and refinement).\- Participate in design of wet lab experiments to test computationally derived models.\- Identify and resolve conflicts in meeting technical needs\- Engage and support the product development processRequirementsStrong scientific background in epidemiology/systems or computational biology/computer science/mathematics3-5 years post-qualification experience as a data scientist, systems biologist or in a similar roleExperience in the analysis of large-scale omics dataExperience in machine learning or other modeling methodsFull English proficiencyAdditional qualifications desiredStrong knowledge of modern ML algorithms and the limits of their applicationExperience in deep learning frameworks - Keras/TensorFlow/PyTorch and an understanding of neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, etc.)Broad understanding of relational databases, SQL, and ability to design a database with several dozen entitiesExperience with ChIP-seq data and motif discoverySome experience in aging research, gene editing, optimization techniques, cell culture techniques, general molecular biology methods, and/or imaging.We welcome open-minded candidates who have excellent problem-solving and team-oriented personalities and are not afraid to make a difference."

This upfront guarantee regardless of occupancy (e.g.: $5,500/mo starting in 28 days) is disrupting the property management industry with big data and technology operations. The company uses modern data science to efficiently model risk alongside operations technology that enables consistent high-quality service at scale. Doorstead eliminates vacancy risk, makes the market more efficient and gives property owners true peace of mind. Doorstead has a fantastic team with 5 second-time founders and veterans from Uber, Opendoor, and Expedia.Our IndustryProperty management is an industry bogged down by inefficient processes and misaligned incentives that create a poor service experience for owners. Today, technology is decoupled from operational processes, such as scheduling showings, back-and-forth communication and managing repairs. Additionally, property managers overpromise on rental prices to get people to sign and have no consequence for slow tenant placement, while owners have months of vacancy and lost income. These inefficiencies lead property-management incumbents to have a 43-day vacancy average, much of which is unnecessary. This leads to an $86 billion annual economic waste in the U.S. alone.Your RoleYour mission as Head of Product Marketing is to engage property owners, build their trust, and serve them with propositions & content that make their lives better. You'll own the voice of the customer for Doorstead by developing a deep understanding of property owners' needs and characteristics.

You'll work closely with sales, performance marketing, product, and leadership teams to bring new product marketing programs to life, and learn how to make them better through experimentation and data analysis. You'll report to the VP of Growth. Your responsibilities, including people management, will expand as Doorstead grows exponentially.
