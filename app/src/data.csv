background the mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement  with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord  we seek to understand  1  the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord   2  how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior  and  3  how these cells are integrated into central nervous system wide networks for complex movement  we have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years  sathyamurthy and johnson et al   2018  matson et al   2018  skinnider et al   2020  and russ and patterson et al   2020   now  we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement  each specific muscle contraction  are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons  ultimately  we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury to do this  we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity  we will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams  we will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships  “decode” neural activity  and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types  we will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement  finally  to fully leverage the power of these large and rich
